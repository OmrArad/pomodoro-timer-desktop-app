# Development Journal

## Overview
This journal documents the development process of the Pomodoro App, highlighting the collaborative workflow between human input, AI assistance (Cursor/ChatGPT), and design prototyping with Stitch.

## Process Summary

### 1. Initial Planning & Design
- Used **Stitch** to prototype the initial UI/UX, focusing on a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.
- Outlined core features: Pomodoro timer, task management, modals for settings/statistics, and data persistence.
- **Note:** This was my first time using Stitch for design prototyping.

### 2. AI Pair Programming with Cursor
- Leveraged **Cursor** (AI coding assistant powered by ChatGPT) for:
  - Generating and refactoring React/TypeScript components
  - Suggesting code structure, state management, and error handling
  - Writing and improving unit tests
  - Creating and updating documentation (README, API docs)
  - Providing git commit message suggestions and workflow organization
- Used a prompt-driven workflow, iteratively refining code and design based on feedback and requirements.
- **Note:** This was also my first time using Cursor for AI-assisted coding.

### 3. Human Collaboration & Decision-Making
- Provided high-level requirements, clarified goals, and made architectural decisions.
- Wrote and edited prompts to guide AI output, ensuring code quality and project alignment.
- Manually reviewed, tested, and adjusted code for edge cases, usability, and polish.

### 4. Key Prompts & Interactions
- **Stitch Prompt Examples:**
  1. "A Pomodoro Timer: Work timer with statistics and productivity tracking" — generated the main page with missing details which were added later.
  2. "add statistics and settings window" — generated a basic statistics page, and an impressive visual page.
  3. "further details on the statistics page" — generated a stylish statistics page.
  4. "lets go back to the original main page. add to it a button that opens the statistics page, and short/long break options. add also an option to add tasks (instead of just 'work')" — generated a more visually impressive main page.
- **Cursor Prompt Examples:**
  - "Implement CRUD operations for tasks with add, edit, delete, and mark as done."
  - "Add error handling for empty task input."
  - "Persist tasks to localStorage and load on app start."
  - "Refactor the header for a three-part flex layout."
  - "Write a unit test for the add task operation."
  - "Generate a comprehensive README and API documentation."
  - "Suggest a git commit message for this change."

### 5. Outcome
- Delivered a robust, well-documented Pomodoro app with clear code, tests, and documentation.
- Achieved a productive blend of human creativity, AI efficiency, and design best practices.
