17:00 - I wanted to use this assignment as a chance to experiment with new and unfamiliar AI tools.
I started by generating designs using Stitch which generates UIs for mobile and web applications, using AI.
Prompts:
1. "A Pomodoro Timer: Work timer with statistics and productivity tracking" - generated the main page with missing details which were added later.
2. "add statistics and settings window" - generated a basic statistics page, and an impresive visual page.
3. "further details on the statistics page" - generated a stylish statistics page.
4. "lets go back to the original main page. add to it a button that opens the statistics page, and short/long break options. add also an option to add tasks (instead of just "work")" - generated a more visually imprisive main page.

17:45 - Download and install Electron and Cursor.
I wanted a good foundation for an Electron web app that is written in Typescript (The tutorial provides one with js) so I used this boilerplate: https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/tree/main

18:15 - Connected git, created a repository.
